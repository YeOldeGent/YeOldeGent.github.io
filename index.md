"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. 
It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord 
of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to
create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared 
about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to
be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, 
which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,
then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not 
himself."
```
Is it possible to learn this power?

Not from an AI.

My role on this project was to ensure a smooth user experience with the UI.

This project was a rough one with many complications. Most notibly, avoiding spaghetti code.
